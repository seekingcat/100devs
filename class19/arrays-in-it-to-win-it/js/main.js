//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.

const movies = ['Amadeus', 'Independence Day', 'Sister Act 2'];

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

let bestMovie = movies[0];

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

let moviesLib = movies.length;

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?

let lastMovie = movies[moviesLib - 1];
